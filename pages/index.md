# Introduction

Welcome to **NixPHP** â€” a minimalist, modern PHP microframework.

## Overview

NixPHP is a lightweight PHP framework that provides the essential tools for web development while remaining simple and flexible. It adheres to modern PHP standards and gives developers full control over their application architecture.

## Target Audience

NixPHP is designed for developers who need:

- Full control over their application's structure
- Minimal dependencies and maximum flexibility
- Native PHP capabilities with PSR compliance (PSR-3, PSR-4, PSR-7, PSR-11, PSR-18)
- A framework that stays out of the way while providing necessary functionality

## Core Features

NixPHP includes:

- **Routing** for URL handling and HTTP method mapping
- **Controllers** for organizing request handling logic
- **View System** with layout support and template inheritance
- **Database Access** through straightforward PDO integration
- **Session Management** for state handling
- **Response Handling** with content negotiation
- **Plugin System** for extending functionality
- **PSR Compatibility** for integration with the PHP ecosystem

All components are designed to be minimal, with no unnecessary abstractions or dependencies.

## Design Principles

NixPHP focuses on providing just enough structure without imposing architectural decisions. The framework:

- Uses plain PHP wherever possible
- Avoids complex abstractions and magic methods
- Keeps dependencies to a minimum
- Follows PSR standards for interoperability

Use NixPHP as a foundation for APIs, web applications, or any PHP project that values **clarity**, **speed**, and **simplicity**.
